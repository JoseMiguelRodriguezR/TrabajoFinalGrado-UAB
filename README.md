# XatBot - Automated Telegram Chatbot to Solve Students' Frequently Asked Questions

This code is created for academic purposes with the objective of developing an automatic, fast, efficient, and sustainable solution that still maintains a human sensibility to solve students' frequently asked questions using the Telegram Chat application.
This is a skeleton, the first version of a program that has been designed to:
- Provide answers to students.
- Help them study a particular subject incrementally.
- Allow students to contact teachers directly within the app.
- Allow teachers to collect frequently asked questions from students about their subject to upload to the app.
